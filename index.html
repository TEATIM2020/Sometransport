      Odessa's tram - This tram is not the quickest way to get around the city, but the cheapest. It doesn't matter how much time you will be on tram, and after how many stops you will get off the tram. It always costs from 5 to 7 UAH. Sometimes it's not very comfortable because there can be a lot of people and less seats, so you need to stand there. When you pay in the tram you can use only your cash, there's no contactless payment, special cards. When you pay - guy that works there gives you a ticket which you need to show when you get off the tram

      A taxi - Not only one of the quickest ways to get around the city, but still the safest way. There are more than 10 companies that can give you a taxi! The best and the most famous are: "Bond", "Uber", "Bolt", "838" and "Shark" that you can see  on the photo. Every company has different prices, cars and drivers. In the taxi you can pay by a credit card, which you can connect in taxi's mobile app, and with cash. The price, for example, in <a href="https://bond.od.ua/">"Bond"</a> starts from 50 UAH, and then, when you arrive, driver's mobile app counts how much do you need to pay.

     Odessa's troleybus - quite similar transport to the tram, but bigger, more comforteble, and faster. There is the same system of payment as in the tram, but it costs 4 UAH. It's quite popular way to get around the city, but it has some problems. First prombel is the same as in the tram - there can be more passengers than seats. Second - in the old troleybuses and trams can be bad seats, doors, walls, etc.
